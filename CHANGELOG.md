# Changelog — Vacuum Water Monitor

## [4.1.3] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- Removed Google Fonts CDN @import (1 occurrence(s)); now uses system font stack with Inter as the preferred locally-installed face.
- Normalized bare `font-family: "Inter", sans-serif` declarations to a complete cross-platform system stack.
- Privacy section in README: claim now matches behaviour (no CDN dependencies).

All notable changes to **Vacuum Water Monitor** are documented here.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-05-10

### Major
- **Split from `MacSiem/ha-tools` monorepo** into a dedicated standalone HACS plugin.
- Bundled Bento Design System CSS inline — no shared dependency required.
- Inlined `_haToolsEsc` XSS sanitizer.
- Persistence keys migrated to per-tool namespace `ha-vacuum-water-monitor-…` (clean break — old data under `ha-tools-…` is **not** migrated automatically).
- Donation/support footer added to the panel.
- Cross-tool discovery banner removed; each tool stands on its own.

### Compatibility

- Home Assistant ≥ 2024.1.0
